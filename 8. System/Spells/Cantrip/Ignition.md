You snap your fingers and point at a target, which begins to smolder. Make a spell attack roll against the target's AC, dealing 2d4 fire damage on a hit. If the target is within your melee reach, you can choose to make a melee spell attack with the flame instead of a ranged spell attack, which increases all the spell's damage dice to d6s.
- **Critical Success** The target takes double damage and 1d4 persistent fire damage.
- **Success** The target takes full damage.

**Heightened (+1)** The initial damage increases by 1d4 and the persistent fire damage on a critical hit increases by 1d4.
