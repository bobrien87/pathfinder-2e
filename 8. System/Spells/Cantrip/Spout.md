Water blasts upward, coming out of the ground, rising from a pool, or even manifesting from thin air. Any creatures in the area take 2d4 bludgeoning damage, with a basic Reflex saving throw. A creature that critically fails its save is disoriented by the explosion of water, becoming [[Off Guard]] until the end of your next turn.

You can change this spell's area to a @Template[burst|distance:5], provided you center the burst in a body of water. This body of water can be as small as a pond or creek, but not as small as a puddle or bathtub.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.
