Using simple magical gestures, you alter a minor detail of your appearance (add or remove highlights to your hair color, apply or remove cosmetics, add polish or accessories to your nails, etc.) or create a small environmental effect that's confined to your person (adjust surrounding lighting to favor your good side, cause a brief wind to make your hair blow dramatically, make a small chime occur as you smile, etc.). While the spell is active, you can Sustain it to make further adjustments. The changes persist until the spell's duration ends.

At the GM's discretion, such alterations might grant a +1 status bonus to certain tasks, such as Impersonate or [[Perform]].
