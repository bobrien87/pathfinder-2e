While in a crowd of roughly similar creatures, your appearance becomes bland and nondescript. You gain a +2 status bonus to Deception and Stealth checks to go incognito among the crowd, and you ignore difficult terrain caused by the crowd. This counts as setting up a disguise for the [[Impersonate]] use of Deception and you add your level even if you're untrained.

> [!danger] Effect: Spell Effect: Face in the Crowd

**Heightened (3rd)** The spell gains a range of 10 feet and can target up to 10 creatures.
