Your patron drapes a cloak of illusion about you, making you appear as another creature of the same body shape with roughly similar height and weight as yourself. This has the effects of a 3rd-rank [[Illusory Disguise]].

**Heightened (6th)** You can appear as any creature of the same size, even with a completely different body shape.
