You create a vivid, illusory daydream drawn from the images of the target's dreams. The daydream appears in an unoccupied space in range, and you attempt to draw the target toward it.
- **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
- **Success** The target's attention wavers. It becomes [[Fascinated]] by the daydream.
- **Failure** The target is fascinated with the daydream and pursues a course of action you choose as its first action after you Cast the Spell: approach the daydream, run away from it (as the [[Fleeing]] condition), Release what it's holding as an offering, or Drop Prone in obeisance.
- **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target follows the course of action for as many actions as possible for the spell's duration, and does nothing else.
