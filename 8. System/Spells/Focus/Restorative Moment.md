Your patron weaves the threads of time around the target, giving them some of the benefits of a day's passage. The target decreases the values of any [[Doomed]] and [[Drained]] conditions it has by 1 and can immediately attempt one saving throw against each affliction it has with a stage length of 1 day or less. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 day.
