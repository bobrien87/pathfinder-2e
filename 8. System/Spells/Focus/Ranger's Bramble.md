You cause plants in the area to entangle your foes, with the effects of [[Entangling Flora]]. A creature that critically fails the save takes @Damage[(max(0,@item.level -1))d4[bleed]] damage in addition to being [[Immobilized]]. [[Escaping]] your bramble doesn't end the bleed damage.

**Heightened (+1)** The bleed damage on a critical failure increases by 1d4.
