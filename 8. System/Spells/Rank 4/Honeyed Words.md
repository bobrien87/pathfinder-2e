Falsehoods pass your lips as smoothly as silk. You gain a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to [[Lie]] and against Perception checks to discern if you are telling the truth, and you add your level even if untrained. If the implausibility of your lies prompts a circumstance penalty or a DC increase, reduce that penalty by half or increase it by half.
