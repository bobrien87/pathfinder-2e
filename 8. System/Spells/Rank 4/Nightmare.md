You send disturbing nightmares to your target. The next time the target falls asleep, it must attempt a Will save. If you know the target only by name and have never met them, the target gets a +4 circumstance bonus to the Will save.
- **Critical Success** The target suffers no adverse effects and is temporarily immune for 1 week.
- **Success** The target experiences the nightmares but suffers no adverse effects other than unpleasant memories.
- **Failure** The target experiences the nightmares and awakens [[Fatigued]].
- **Critical Failure** The target experiences the nightmares, awakens Fatigued, and is [[Drained]] 2 until it is no longer Fatigued.
