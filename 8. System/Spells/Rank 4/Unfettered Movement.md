You repel effects that would hinder a creature or slow its movement. While under this spell's effect, the target ignores effects that would give them a circumstance penalty to Speed. When they attempt to [[Escape]] an effect that has them [[Immobilized]], [[Grabbed]], or [[Restrained]], they automatically succeed unless the effect is magical and of a higher rank than the *unfettered movement* spell.
