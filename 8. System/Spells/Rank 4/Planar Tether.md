You stitch the target to its current plane. While the target is affected by *planar tether*, the spell attempts to counteract any teleportation effect that would move the target, or any effect that would transport it to a different plane. *Planar tether*'s duration is determined by the target's Will save.
- **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
- **Success** The effect's duration is 1 minute.
- **Failure** The effect's duration is 10 minutes.
- **Critical Failure** The effect's duration is 1 hour.
