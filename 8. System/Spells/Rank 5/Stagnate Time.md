You examine the time stream in a particular area, then proceed to stick a few metaphorical pins into it, thickening and slowing down the flow of time until it rumbles along like a river of molasses. Any creature that begins its turn in the area must attempt a Will save.
- **Success** The creature is unaffected.
- **Failure** The creature is [[Slowed]] 1 this turn.
- **Critical Failure** The creature is [[Slowed]] 2 this turn.
