Seeing another creature improve themself with magic, you reach out and seize its benefits for yourself. Attempt a counteract check against the target spell effect. If you successfully counteract the effect, the effect does not end. Instead, you gain the effect of the target spell as well. If you would not be a valid target for the spell, you do not gain any of its benefits.

The spell's duration is halved as you siphon off its magical energy for yourself. Each round that both you and the original creature are affected by the spell counts for two rounds when determining the spell's duration. You can Dismiss the spell.
