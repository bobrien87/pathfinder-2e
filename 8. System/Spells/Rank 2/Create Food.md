You create enough food to feed six Medium creatures for a day. This food is bland and unappealing, but it is nourishing. After 1 day, if no one has eaten the food, it decays and becomes inedible. Most Small creatures eat one-quarter as much as a Medium creature (one-sixteenth as much for most Tiny creatures), and most Large creatures eat 10 times as much (100 times as much for Huge creatures and so on).

**Heightened (4th)** You can feed 12 Medium creatures.

**Heightened (6th)** You can feed 50 Medium creatures.

**Heightened (8th)** You can feed 200 Medium creatures.
