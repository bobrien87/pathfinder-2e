**Trigger** A creature within range is hit with a Strike that deals physical damage.

The target's skin erupts in thick hide or dense scales. It gains resistance 5 to physical damage, except adamantine, until the beginning of its next turn.

> [!danger] Effect: Spell Effect: Hidebound

**Heightened (+2)** The resistance increases by 3.
