You project psychic vibrations onto the target object, imprinting it with a short message or emotional theme of your design. This imprinted sensation is revealed to a creature who casts [[Object Reading]] on the target object, replacing any emotional events the item was present for. If the object is in the area of a [[Retrocognition]] spell, the imprinted messages appear as major events in the timeline, but they don't interfere with any other visions.

If the object is targeted with [[Read Aura]] of a higher spell rank than *imprint message*, the caster learns that the object has been magically modified. When you [[Cast this Spell]], any prior vibrations placed on an object by previous castings of *imprint message* fade.
