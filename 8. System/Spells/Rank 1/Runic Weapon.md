The weapon glimmers with magic as temporary runes carve down its length. The target becomes a *+1 striking weapon*, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and increasing the number of weapon damage dice to two.

**Heightened (6th)** The weapon is *+2 greater striking*.

**Heightened (9th)** The weapon is *+3 major striking*.
