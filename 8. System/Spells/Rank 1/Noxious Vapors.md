You emit a cloud of toxic smoke that temporarily obscures you from sight. Each creature except you in the area when you Cast the Spell takes 1d6 poison damage (basic Fortitude save). A creature that critically fails the saving throw also becomes [[Sickened]] 1. All creatures in the area become [[Concealed]], and all creatures outside the smoke become concealed to creatures within it. This smoke can be dispersed by a strong wind.

**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6
