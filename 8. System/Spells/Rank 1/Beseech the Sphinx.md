You look to the great Sphinx constellation, wisest of all cosmic guides and favored of Phimater, asking them to lend their insight to the target. Choose one skill and one type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will). The target gains a +1 status bonus to those skill checks and saving throws for the duration.

**Heightened (4th)** The status bonus increases to +2.

**Heightened (7th)** The status bonus increases to +3.
