Razor-sharp thorns and claws erupt from your skin or scales. Whenever a creature touches you or hits you with a melee unarmed attack, it takes 1 piercing damage. Additionally, if you become [[Grabbed]], [[Restrained]], or otherwise held [[Immobilized]] in a creature's grasp, such as by being engulfed or swallowed, the creature takes @Damage[(ceil(@item.rank / 2))d4[persistent,bleed]] damage.

**Heightened (+2)** The piercing damage increases by 2, and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1d4.
