You bypass your targets' rational minds, instilling them with unshakable conviction and zeal. The targets each gain 12 temporary Hit Points and a +2 status bonus to Will saves against mental effects, as their faith overrides the signals from their own bodies and minds. If you tell a target to do something, it must comply with your request, though if it would normally find the task repugnant, it can attempt a Will save at the end of its turn each round due to the cognitive dissonance. On a success, it ends the spell's effects on itself entirely.

> [!danger] Effect: Spell Effect: Zealous Conviction

**Heightened (9th)** The temporary Hit Points increase to 18, and the status bonus to Will saves increases to +3.
