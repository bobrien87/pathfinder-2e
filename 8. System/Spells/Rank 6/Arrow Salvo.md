You conjure an immense wooden bow that launches a salvo of massive arrows at all nearby enemies. All creatures in the affected area take 8d10 piercing damage, with a basic Reflex save. On a critical failure, the target is knocked [[Prone]] from the force of the impact.

**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 1d10.
