**Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a magical effect, but you haven't rolled yet

**Effect** You call on the power of a personal, eldritch sign of protection, which flares brightly before slowly fading. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw, or a +3 circumstance bonus if the effect is a curse.
