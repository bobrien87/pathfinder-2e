This *+2 greater striking longsword* sports no extravagant characteristics save for a blade of pure, unblemished ivory and a hilt of unmarred obsidian. It takes on the propensity of its user, turning whiter or darker based on their actions.

The effects of *life's duality* are based on the number and type of charges it has. It begins with 0 charges and can gain either dark or light charges, up to a maximum of 3 charges of one type. A charge dissipates after 10 minutes or when a charge of the opposite type is gained. If you have a charge of one type and would gain the opposite type of charge, you lose your current charges.

*Life's duality* gains a dark charge when it critically succeeds at a Strike against an opponent or reduces the Hit Points of a living enemy to 0. For each dark charge it has, it deals an additional 1d4 void damage (maximum 3d4).

*Life's duality* gains a light charge when you use a spell, skill check, or ability to restore at least 10 Hit Points to an ally. The damage healed must have been inflicted by a significant foe or threat. For each light charge it has, you gain 1d4 temporary Hit Points at the end of each round (maximum 3d4).

**Activate—Burst of Duality** `pf2:3` (concentrate)

**Requirements** *Life's duality* has 3 dark charges or 3 light charges;

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** You unleash the sword's charged energy in a magical display. You cast a 3-action 5th-rank [[Harm]] spell if you have 3 dark charges or a 3-action 5th-rank [[Heal]] spell if you have 3 light charges (DC 30 [[Fortitude]] save). The sword then reverts to having 0 charges.
