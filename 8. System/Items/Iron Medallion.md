**Trigger** You attempt a Will save against a fear effect but haven't rolled yet

This small medallion is shaped like a shield. When you activate it, you gain a +2 status bonus to the triggering save and other saves against fear for 1 minute. On the triggering save, if the outcome of your roll is a failure, you get a success instead. If the outcome is a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
