A silver Razmiri mask grants a +2 item bonus to Deception checks to [[Lie]] or [[Feint]].

**Activate—Call Upon Razmir's Benevolence** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate, occult)

**Frequency** once per minute

**Effect** You bend "divine" power to your will using the techniques taught you by the Razmiri priesthood. You grant a single target you touch a number of temporary Hit Points equal to twice your level that last for 24 hours. If the target was [[Unconscious]], it regains consciousness and doesn't lose consciousness again due to Hit Point loss as long as it has temporary Hit Points from this effect remaining.

> [!danger] Effect: Call Upon Razmir's Benevolence

**Activate—Call Upon Razmir's Mercy** `pf2:2` (concentrate, manipulate, occult)

**Frequency** three times per day

**Effect** Exhorting Razmir to purge impurities from your target, you lay hands on a creature within reach and cast [[Cleanse Affliction]] as an occult spell with a spell rank equal to half your level. Unlike a normal *cleanse affliction* spell, this doesn't reduce the stage of the affliction; instead, if the counteract check is successful, the affliction's stage is temporarily reduced by 1 and its effects are suppressed for 24 hours, after which the affliction resumes in full force.

If the target would have been required to attempt additional saves against the affliction during the 24 hours it was suppressed, they must attempt all of those saving throws as soon as the 24-hour duration ends. This could mean that the target saves successfully and it is as if the affliction were truly healed, or it could mean that the affliction returns and advances multiple stages all at once.
