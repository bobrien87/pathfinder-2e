While dormant, this tattoo appears to be a simple flower bud, but when activated the flower swiftly blossoms, remaining that way until the next time you make your daily preparations. These blooms are colorful, elegant representations of red rose flowers.

**Frequency** once per day

**Effect** Choose a willing ally you can see within 30 feet. The ally fills with feelings of love. They choose a creature that the ally has strong positive emotions toward as beloved. While the ally is within 10 feet of this beloved, the ally gains a +1 status bonus to saving throws. If the ally starts their turn within 10 feet of the beloved, the ally gains 5 temporary Hit Points. These benefits last for 1 minute, and temporary HP remaining from this effect at the end of that time disappear. This effect has the emotion and mental traits.
