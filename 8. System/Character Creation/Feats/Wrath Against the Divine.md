You channel your commitment to removing the divine from the world as you recite the Laws of Mortality. Strike a foe that can cast divine spells. The Strike deals two extra weapon damage dice. The target must also attempt a [[Will]] save against your class DC. On a failure, it loses its highest-rank available divine spell prepared or its highest unused spell slot to cast a divine spell. If it has multiple spells at its highest rank available, it randomly selects which spell is lost. On a critical failure, it also can't cast divine spells until the start of your next turn.
