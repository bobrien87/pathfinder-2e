### `= this.file.name`
**Feat** `= this.level`
`= choice(this.traits != null and length(this.traits) > 0, join(this.traits, " "), "")`

`= choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "", "**Prerequisites** " + this.prerequisites, "") + choice(this.access != null and this.access != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "", "<br>", "") + "**Access** " + this.access, "") + choice(this.frequency != null and this.frequency != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "" or this.access != null and this.access != "", "<br>", "") + "**Frequency** " + this.frequency, "") + choice(this.trigger != null and this.trigger != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "" or this.access != null and this.access != "" or this.frequency != null and this.frequency != "", "<br>", "") + "**Trigger** " + this.trigger, "") + choice(this.requirements != null and this.requirements != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "" or this.access != null and this.access != "" or this.frequency != null and this.frequency != "" or this.trigger != null and this.trigger != "", "<br>", "") + "**Requirements** " + this.requirements, "")`

**Requirements** You are unarmored

Your arms flutter like a crane's wings.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, but the only Strikes you can make are crane wing attacks. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

While in Crane Stance, reduce the DC for High Jump and Long Jump by 5, and when you Leap, you can move an additional 5 feet horizontally or 2 feet vertically.
