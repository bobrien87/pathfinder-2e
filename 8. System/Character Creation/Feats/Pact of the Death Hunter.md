You've sworn a pact with a psychopomp bent on the destruction of all undeath. You gain an imprecise deathsense that can detect undead creatures up to 60 feet away. Additionally, whenever an undead creature is destroyed within 60 feet you gain temporary Hit Points equal to its level that last for 1 minute.

In exchange, the psychopomp requires that you never aid in the creation or conquest of an undead creature. You must also seek out and put to rest any mindless or destructive undead creatures you come across.
