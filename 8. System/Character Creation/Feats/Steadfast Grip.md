The connection you have with your warshard weapon strengthens it and assists you in maintaining your grip on it in battle. Your DCs against attempts made to [[Disarm]], [[Steal]], or otherwise remove your warshard weapon from your possession are calculated at mythic proficiency. When you designate a warshard weapon, its Hardness increases by an amount equal to half your level, and its Hit Points increase by an amount equal to your level for as long as it is your warshard weapon.
