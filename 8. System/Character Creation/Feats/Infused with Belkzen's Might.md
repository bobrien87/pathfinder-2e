Your tattoos immortalize the conquests of orc war leaders, such as Belkzen besieging the dwarven Sky Citadel of Koldukar. You can expend one use of your storied skin's Living History ability to channel this power into your own weapons. Until the end of your next turn, you deal additional spirit damage with weapons and unarmed attacks equal to 1 plus half the number of Tattooed Historian feats you have.
