Your ability to manipulate supernatural energy allows you to deploy divine magic directly against a disguised enemy to reveal them as they truly are, or to cleanse an ally from an unwilling transformation. Attempt a [[Religion]] check to counteract a polymorph effect currently affecting a creature within 30 feet of you that you are aware of. The target is then temporarily immune to Banish Falsehoods of Flesh for 1 day.
