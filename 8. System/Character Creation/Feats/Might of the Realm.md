Bolstered by the presence of your knights, you strike a mighty blow in the name of your rule. Strike an enemy. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits, you deal an additional amount of damage equal to double the number of your designated knights whom you can see. If the Strike is a critical hit, the target is also [[Enfeebled]] 1 until the start of your next turn.
