You shift and skip through time, vanishing during your movement to appear in unexpected and advantageous locations for combat. Spend a Mythic Point. Strike, then Step up to 10 feet. This movement is affected normally by barriers and difficult terrain; you still move physically through the area, just so swiftly that it appears that you've teleported. Then, make another Strike. Apply your multiple attack penalty to both Strikes normally, but this second Strike is made at mythic proficiency and your target is [[Off Guard]] against it.
