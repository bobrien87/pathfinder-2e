You make yourself appear to be a tempting target to draw an enemy in, distracting them from your student's attacks. Choose an enemy creature within 60 feet that you are aware of. You take a –1 penalty to your AC against that creature's Strikes until the beginning of your next turn, and your student gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their Strikes against the target creature during that time.
