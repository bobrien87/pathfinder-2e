**Feat** `= this.level`
`= choice(this.traits != null and length(this.traits) > 0, join(this.traits, " "), "")`

`= choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "", "**Prerequisites** " + this.prerequisites, "") + choice(this.access != null and this.access != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "", "<br>", "") + "**Access** " + this.access, "") + choice(this.frequency != null and this.frequency != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "" or this.access != null and this.access != "", "<br>", "") + "**Frequency** " + this.frequency, "") + choice(this.trigger != null and this.trigger != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "" or this.access != null and this.access != "" or this.frequency != null and this.frequency != "", "<br>", "") + "**Trigger** " + this.trigger, "") + choice(this.requirements != null and this.requirements != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "" or this.access != null and this.access != "" or this.frequency != null and this.frequency != "" or this.trigger != null and this.trigger != "", "<br>", "") + "**Requirements** " + this.requirements, "")`

**Trigger** You become [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]] by a creature.

You counter the creature with the power of elemental water, a tendril of it encasing your limb or weapon. You attempt an Athletics check to [[Grapple]] the triggering creature, even if it's outside your reach or you don't have a free hand. If you succeed, you also remove the triggering condition, and the tendril of water pulls the creature adjacent to you before dissipating.
