Enough of your life has been spent performing that you've mastered the art of the quick change—especially when it comes to armor or invested items. You can remove any armor as a 3-action Interact activity. You can don light armor in 2 rounds, or in 1 minute for medium or heavy armor. You gain the [[Impromptu Investment]] activity.
