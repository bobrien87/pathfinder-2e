Your broken bones jut at odd angles, yet this pain only adds to your anger and prowess. You add the combined value of your [[Doomed]] and [[Wounded]] conditions as a circumstance bonus to damage rolls with your melee attacks (for example, if you were doomed 1 and wounded 2, you would gain a +3 circumstance bonus to your melee damage rolls).
