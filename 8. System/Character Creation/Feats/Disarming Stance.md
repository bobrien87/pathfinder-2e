**Requirements** You are wielding a single one-handed melee weapon and hold nothing else in your hands.

You adopt a fencing stance that improves your control over your weapon. While you are in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to [[Disarm]] and a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC when defending against checks to Disarm you. In addition, you can attempt to Disarm creatures up to two sizes larger than you.
