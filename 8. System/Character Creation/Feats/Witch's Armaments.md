Your patron's power changes your body to ensure you are never defenseless. You gain one of the following unarmed attacks.

- **Eldritch Nails** Your nails are supernaturally long and sharp. You gain a nails unarmed attack that deals 1d6 slashing damage, is in the brawling group, and has the agile and unarmed traits.

- **Iron Teeth** With a click of your jaw, your teeth transform into long metallic points. You gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage and is in the brawling group.

- **Living Hair** You can instantly grow or shrink your hair, eyebrows, beard, or mustache by up to several feet and manipulate your hair for use as a weapon, though your control isn't fine enough for more dexterous tasks. You gain a hair unarmed attack that deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage; is in the brawling group; and has the agile, disarm, finesse, trip, and unarmed traits.

**Special** You can take this feat more than once, gaining a different unarmed attack each time.
