You channel disruptive power that severs a foe's spiritual connection to their magic. Make a melee Strike. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If the attack hits, the target takes 1d6 persistent,spirit damage. The target is [[Stupefied 1]] until it stops taking the persistent spirit damage.
