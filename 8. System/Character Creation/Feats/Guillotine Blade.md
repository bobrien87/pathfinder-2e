**Frequency** once per day

The echoes of the splinter of finality's original purpose resonate through the artifact. For the next minute, your [[Spectral Dagger]] gains the benefits of a [[Vorpal]] rune. When you use Snicker-Snack with your *spectral dagger*, the DC of the [[Fortitude]] save is 37, your class DC, or your spell DC, whichever is higher.
