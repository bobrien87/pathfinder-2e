Infused with celestial light, your magic can more effectively heal wounds and purge afflictions. If your next action is to Cast a Spell with the healing trait on a living creature, one target of that spell regains a @Damage[(@actor.level)[healing]]{number of Hit Points equal to your level} (in addition to any Hit Points they would normally gain). In addition, you can attempt to counteract a disease or poison affecting one target of that spell. These two targets can be the same creature or different creatures, as long as they are both targets of the healing spell.
