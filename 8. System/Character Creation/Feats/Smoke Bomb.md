You can add a tarry additive to an alchemical bomb to make it emit smoke. When thrown, in addition to its normal effects, the bomb creates a cloud of smoke in a @Template[burst|distance:10]. You choose which corner of the target's space (or the space in which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on. Creatures within that area have the [[Concealed]] condition, and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind.
