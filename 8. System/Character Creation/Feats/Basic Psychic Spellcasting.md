You gain the [[Basic Spellcasting Feat]] benefits. When you gain a spell slot of a new rank from the psychic archetype, add a spell of the appropriate spell rank to your repertoire: a common occult spell, one of the granted spells from your conscious mind, or another spell you've learned or discovered.
