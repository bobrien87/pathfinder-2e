Buoyed by your fearsome reputation, your steed can take flight. Your apocalypse mount gains a fly Speed equal to its land Speed. If it already has a fly speed, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to [[Maneuver in Flight]]. At night, or in any environment deprived of natural sunlight, your apocalypse mount gains a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its fly Speed, and critical failures on Acrobatics checks to Maneuver in Flight become failures instead.
