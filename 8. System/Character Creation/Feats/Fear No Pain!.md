**Trigger** An ally within 30 feet fails a save against a mental effect.

You have learned to endure pain without complaint and are capable of steeling your allies with similar resolve. When you give them a shout of encouragement, the triggering ally can reroll their failed save with a +2 circumstance bonus.

> [!danger] Effect: Fear No Pain!
