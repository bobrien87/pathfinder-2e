You sing annoying goblin songs, distracting your foes with silly and repetitive lyrics. Attempt a Performance check against the Will DC of a single enemy within 30 feet. This has all the usual traits and restrictions of a Performance check to sing.

You can affect up to two targets within range if you have expert proficiency in Performance, four if you have master proficiency, and eight if you have legendary proficiency.
- **Critical Success** The target takes a –1 status penalty to Perception checks and Will saves for 1 minute.

> [!danger] Effect: Goblin Song (Critical Success)
- **Success** The target takes a –1 status penalty to Perception checks and Will saves for 1 round.
