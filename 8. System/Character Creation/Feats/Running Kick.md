Your companion weaves in and out of combat, swiftly attacking before getting to a better position. Your companions with a qualifying unarmed attack learn the Running Kick activity.

**Running Kick** `pf2:2` This companion Strides up to twice its Speed and makes a hoof, foot, or talon Strike at any point during the movement. This movement doesn't provoke reactions from a creature damaged by the Strike.
