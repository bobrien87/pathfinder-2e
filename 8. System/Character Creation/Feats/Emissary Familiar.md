You forge a mystical bond with a spirit or create a spirit from a fragment of your own soul. You gain a familiar. If you already have a familiar, you gain the [[Enhanced Familiar]] feat.

Your familiar gains two additional familiar abilities each day, one of which must be used to select [[Synchronize Spirit]].
