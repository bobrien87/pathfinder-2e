You modify an arrow or bolt to bring death to your target in a single potent hit. Make a bow or crossbow Strike. On a hit, you deal an additional 10d10 precision damage. On a critical hit, the target must also succeed at a [[Fortitude]] save saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC or be immediately slain; this save has the death and incapacitation traits.
