**Requirements** You haven't used this ability since you last Raged.

You stoke an ally's fury. While you are raging, one willing creature within 30 feet gains the effects of the Rage action, except it can still use concentrate actions. It doesn't get any added benefits from your instinct, feats, or the like.

> [!danger] Effect: Share Rage
