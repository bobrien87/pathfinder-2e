Your bites carry a cursed infection. When you hit and deal damage to a creature with a jaws Strike while in hybrid or rat shape, the creature is cursed until the start of your next turn. Whenever they regain Hit Points during that time, they must attempt a [[Fortitude]] save against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.
- **Success** The creature regains Hit Points normally.
- **Failure** The creature regains half the normal Hit Points.
- **Critical Failure** The creature regains no Hit Points.

**Source:** `= this.source` (`= this.source-type`)
