**Access** You're from Druma.

You have entered the ranks of the Mercenary League and now wear the black uniform that's the source of the organization's popular epithet. You become trained in Intimidation; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You gain the [[Additional Lore]] skill feat for Warfare Lore; if you were already trained in Warfare Lore, you also become trained in a Lore skill of your choice. While wearing medium or heavy armor, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Intimidation checks.
