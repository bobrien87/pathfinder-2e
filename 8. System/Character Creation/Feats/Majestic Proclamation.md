**Feat** `= this.level`
`= choice(this.traits != null and length(this.traits) > 0, join(this.traits, " "), "")`

`= choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "", "**Prerequisites** " + this.prerequisites, "") + choice(this.access != null and this.access != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "", "<br>", "") + "**Access** " + this.access, "") + choice(this.frequency != null and this.frequency != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "" or this.access != null and this.access != "", "<br>", "") + "**Frequency** " + this.frequency, "") + choice(this.trigger != null and this.trigger != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "" or this.access != null and this.access != "" or this.frequency != null and this.frequency != "", "<br>", "") + "**Trigger** " + this.trigger, "") + choice(this.requirements != null and this.requirements != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "" or this.access != null and this.access != "" or this.frequency != null and this.frequency != "" or this.trigger != null and this.trigger != "", "<br>", "") + "**Requirements** " + this.requirements, "")`

**Requirements** You're in your sentinel form.

You announce your name to your enemies, bringing your constellation to bear in a blinding display. Attempt to [[Demoralize]] all enemies within 30 feet. Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait when used this way. In addition to the regular effects of Demoralize, enemies become [[Dazzled]] for 1 minute on a successful check (and also [[Blinded]] for 1 round on a critical success).

You can use Majestic Proclamation as a single action if your previous action was [[Starlit Transformation]].

**Source:** `= this.source` (`= this.source-type`)
