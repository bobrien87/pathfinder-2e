You've honed your reflexes so well that your lash can begin closing around a target as soon as it makes contact. Make a lash Strike; if the Strike hits, you can immediately attempt to [[Grapple]] the target. Both actions count toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you've made both attacks.
