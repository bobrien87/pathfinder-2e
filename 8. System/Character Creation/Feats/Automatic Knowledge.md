You know basic facts off the top of your head. Choose a skill you're an expert in that has the Recall Knowledge action and for which you have the Assurance feat. You can use the Recall Knowledge action with that skill as a free action once per round. If you do, you must use Assurance on the skill check.

**Special** You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a different skill each time. You can use Automatic Knowledge with any skills you have chosen, but you can still use Automatic Knowledge only once per round.
