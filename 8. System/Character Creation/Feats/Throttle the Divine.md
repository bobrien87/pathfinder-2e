You grasp the godly by their throats and damage their connection to their deities. When you have a creature [[Grabbed]], it must roll its flat check to use manipulate actions with the divine trait twice and take the worse result. Each time it attempts such an action while you have it grabbed, you tighten your grip further, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to @Damage[(2d6 + @actor.abilities.str.mod)[bludgeoning]]{2d6 + your Strength modifier} to that target.
