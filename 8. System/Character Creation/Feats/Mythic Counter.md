You can overwhelm the magical designs of others with sheer magic power. When you attempt a counteract check against a spell, you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. If the target of the counteract check is within your [[Spellsurge]] aura, critical failures on this check are treated as failures.
