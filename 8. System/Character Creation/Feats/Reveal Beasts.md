You're adept at revealing—or creating—fear among those who threaten civilization. If you succeed at a check to [[Recall Knowledge]] to identify an animal, beast, fungus, or plant, you get a critical success instead. Additionally, whenever you critically succeed at a check to Recall Knowledge against an animal, beast, fungus, or plant, that creature becomes [[Frightened]] 1.
