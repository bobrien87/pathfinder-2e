You flash through several possible timelines as you move. Stride up to your Speed. This movement doesn't provoke reactions, and you are [[Concealed]] until the end of your turn. All creatures are [[Off Guard]] to you until the end of your turn. You can use Now You See Me while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
