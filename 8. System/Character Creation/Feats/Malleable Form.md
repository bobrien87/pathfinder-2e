**Feat** `= this.level`
`= choice(this.traits != null and length(this.traits) > 0, join(this.traits, " "), "")`

`= choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "", "**Prerequisites** " + this.prerequisites, "") + choice(this.access != null and this.access != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "", "<br>", "") + "**Access** " + this.access, "") + choice(this.frequency != null and this.frequency != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "" or this.access != null and this.access != "", "<br>", "") + "**Frequency** " + this.frequency, "") + choice(this.trigger != null and this.trigger != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "" or this.access != null and this.access != "" or this.frequency != null and this.frequency != "", "<br>", "") + "**Trigger** " + this.trigger, "") + choice(this.requirements != null and this.requirements != "", choice(this.prerequisites != null and this.prerequisites != "" or this.access != null and this.access != "" or this.frequency != null and this.frequency != "" or this.trigger != null and this.trigger != "", "<br>", "") + "**Requirements** " + this.requirements, "")`

**Requirements** You're polymorphed by a spell that has multiple choices of battle form.

You adroitly shift your form, taking on another appearance. Choose a different battle form of the polymorph spell affecting you, and change to that form instead of the current one. This destabilizes the spell's magic, reducing its duration by 1 round. Use the rank of the spell to determine the statistics, as normal.
