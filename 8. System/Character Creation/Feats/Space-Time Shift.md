**Frequency** once per 10 minutes

**Trigger** Your turn begins.

You travel just a few moments into the future to immediately arrive at your destination. Your Strides are augmented until the end of your turn, allowing you to instantly teleport to any point you could reach with your Stride instead of traversing normally to the location. Your augmented Strides have the teleportation trait and don't trigger reactions that can be triggered by move actions or upon leaving or entering a square. You also augment your Burrow, Climb, Fly, or Swim actions in this way if you have the corresponding movement type.

**Source:** `= this.source` (`= this.source-type`)
