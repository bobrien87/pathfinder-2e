In a pinch, ink from your tattoo arranges itself into a temporary pass, writ of authority, or similar document. If you're in possession of a blank page of paper, you can `act create-forgery traits=concentrate,occult` as a single action with the concentrate and occult traits. The forgery lasts for 1 minute, and during this time, you can't use any of the other abilities of your Talon's Mark. You can Dismiss the forgery, leaving the paper blank once again.

**Source:** `= this.source` (`= this.source-type`)
