Philosophers compare the cycle of life, death, and rebirth to sleeping, dreaming, and waking. You take it to another level by reliving previous lives in dreams, always waking invigorated and thankful for a new chance at life. Whenever you rest for 8 hours, you gain the effects of a long-term rest. If you're an ancestry that neither sleeps nor dreams, you still receive this benefit by entering a reflective, meditative state during rest.
