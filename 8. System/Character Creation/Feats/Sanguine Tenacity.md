Your blood carries permanent regenerative properties. The penalties from [[Enfeebled]] and the penalties and lost HP from [[Drained]] both affect you as if the condition values were 1 lower than they actually are. You also gain resistance 5 to persistent bleed damage and reduce the DC of checks to recover from persistent bleed damage to 11, or 6 if you have particularly effective assistance.
