Being the god of secrets, Norgorber has erased all traces of his life before his ascension so that his every mortal act and even his identity remain unknown and unknowable. Something about this path intrigues you, and you've trained your own mind to defy intrusions. You gain mental resistance equal to half your level and a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that attempt to read your mind or discern your location.
