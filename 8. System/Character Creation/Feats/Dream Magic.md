You learn dream-related magic to aid your studies. Choose [[Dream Message]] or [[Sleep]] upon taking this feat; you learn this spell as a 4th-rank occult innate spell that you can cast once per day. If you choose *sleep*, you can cast the spell only while in a [[Daydream Trance]]. You become trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics, and your spellcasting attribute for these spells is Wisdom.

**Special** You can take this feat twice, gaining the spell you didn't select initially the second time.
