Your pursuit is relentless, and you can magically locate stolen objects and outlaws. You gain [[Locate]] as an innate spell of a tradition of your choice, which you can cast once per day. If you're a member of the Order of the Gate, when you reach 14th level, the spell is heightened to 5th rank.

**Source:** `= this.source` (`= this.source-type`)
