You've learned to use your Twilight Talon's mark to secret away contraband. The tattoo's level increases to 10, unless it was already higher, and it gains the abilities of a greater retrieval belt. As a part of activating the tattoo to Store Item, you can attempt a [[Deception]] check against the Perception DCs of all creatures that are currently observing you. On a success, a creature doesn't notice you use Store Item.

**Source:** `= this.source` (`= this.source-type`)
