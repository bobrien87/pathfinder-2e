You've gained Isthralei's attention and can now offer stories up to him, either passing on your own stories or collecting those of travelers as he did. You become trained in Religion and Survival; for either of these skills in which you were already trained, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the [[Offer Story]] action.
