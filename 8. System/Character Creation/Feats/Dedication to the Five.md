Your dedication to the Godclaw borders on a cleric's. You gain the cleric's [[Domain Initiate]] feat but must select duty, might, perfection, or protection as your domain. Whenever you cast the focus spell gained from this feat, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to twice the spell's rank that last for 1 round. In addition, you can use any religious symbol of Abadar, Asmodeus, Iomedae, Irori, or Uirch as your divine focus.
