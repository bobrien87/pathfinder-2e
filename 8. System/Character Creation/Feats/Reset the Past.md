**Frequency** once per day

You manipulate time to recharge one of your temporal techniques—by revising your past so you never used it in the first place. Select one of your chronoskimmer feats that has a frequency of once per day (or more frequent) that you've already used. You can use the feat again, as if you hadn't used it already.
