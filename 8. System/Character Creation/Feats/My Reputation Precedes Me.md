Long years of brave exploits haven't gone unnoticed. Whether you know just the right things to say or those you're speaking with recognize you as a reincarnated hero, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy checks made to Gather Information or Make An Impression, and to Intimidation checks made to [[Coerce]]. At 18th level, these circumstance bonuses increase to +3. If you spend a Mythic point when you attempt such a check, you do so at mythic proficiency.
