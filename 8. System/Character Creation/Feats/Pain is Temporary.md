Sangpotshi practitioners know that suffering is a fleeting sensation that ultimately strengthens the soul and prepares it for a new reincarnation. Bolstered by this understanding, you've learned to temporarily steel yourself against all forms of pain. You gain resistance 10 to all damage until the end of your next turn.
