You rush forward, flapping your wings for a bit of lift, and can use that momentum to knock down a foe. [[Leap]], and if you land within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can attempt to [[Trip]] that enemy. You don't need to have one hand free. If you successfully knock the target [[Prone]], you can Leap again. If you have a fly Speed, you can Fly instead of Leap.
