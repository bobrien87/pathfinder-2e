You cheat the rules of time to co-locate during your attack. When you use Temporal Fury, your Step can be up to 15 feet. If your second Strike is against the same creature as your first Strike, your second Strike deals an additional die of weapon damage; if both Strikes hit, you combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.
