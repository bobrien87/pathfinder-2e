Like the ocean in a storm, you overwhelm your opponents with speed and force. Move up to your Speed and make two Strikes. These Strikes can happen at any point during your movement. If either Strike reduces a target to 0 Hit Points, you gain the [[Quickened]] condition for 1 round. You can only use the extra action to Stride or Swim.
