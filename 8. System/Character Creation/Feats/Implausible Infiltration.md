**Requirements** You are adjacent to a floor or vertical wall.

You find tiny imperfections and somehow fit yourself through them, possibly moving directly through the wall or floor. Your movement attempt fails if the wall or floor is made of something other than wood, plaster, or stone; is thicker than 10 feet; or contains even a thin layer of metal. If you have a climb Speed, you can use this ability to attempt to move through a ceiling.
