As a mortal herald, you cannot easily be captured, nor can your allies. If you are [[Grabbed]] or [[Restrained]] when you use [[Flash of Omnipresence]], the creature or effect that is imparting that condition on you takes @Damage[(@actor.level)[spirit]]{spirit damage} equal to your level.

If you teleport adjacent to a grabbed or restrained ally using Flash of Omnipresence, attempt a [[Religion]] check against the hard DC for the level of the creature or effect that is imparting that condition. on a success, your ally no longer has that condition.
