Your claws are as sharp as your teeth. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d6 slashing damage. Your claws are in the knife group and have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits. At 5th level, whenever you get a critical hit with your claws or jaws, you get its critical specialization effect.

**Special** If your dragonet heritage is house drake, your claws count as silver.
